  <h2> My understanding of HTML</h2>
  </p>
  <p> HTML which stands for hypertext markup language, is the language used by web developers to write web pages. <br>
    It provides structure to the website and is mainly used by front-end developers, who develops the interface viewers see when they visit a website. <br>
    We write HTML using elements, there are opening and closing tags with the deisred content to be displayed in between the tags. <br>
    There are various versions of HTML with HTML 5 the recent version. <br>
    The HTML web structure consists of several parts of which the main two are the &lthead&gt and &ltbody&gt tags. <br>
    Elements in the body tag are visible on the webpage eg (images, headings, tables,paragraphs, lists,etc), while elements in the head tag give the browser information about the website. <br>
    Some HTML tags has attributes which helps define the content of the tag better, eg, 'src' for the &ltimg&gt tag and 'href' for the &lta&gt tag. </p> <br>
